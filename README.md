# Healy_socviz_python
Python code for Healy's "Data Visualization" book

Kieran Healy's excellent _Data Visualization_ (Princeton, 2019) serves, as its subtitle suggests, as "a practical introduction". It does so using R and `ggplot`. However, many data science students prefer using python. To make the book equally useful to them, I have converted all of chart-generating code in the book to python, building on the invaluable python implementation of `ggplot`, `plotnine`.

These notebooks go chapter by chapter, and include all the code you should need to replicate in nearly identical form all the charts in Healy's book. There are some minor differences due to default layouts & themes, but these are insignificant overall. I have kept the editorializing to a minimum, focusing on just replicating the charts. Where the code is appreciably different, I have added comments to explain what is going on.

If you find these useful, and/or have any corrections or suggestsions, I would love to hear from you.

Enjoy!
